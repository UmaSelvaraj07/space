<h1 style="font-size:60px;text-align:center; "> cosmic rays </h1>

<p style="font-size:15px;text-align :center;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:40px;"> High-energy particles that travel through space at nearly the speed of light.
They are made up of nuclei from natural elements in the periodic table, such as hydrogen, helium, and uranium. 
Cosmic rays are produced by particle accelerators in space, and trillions hit Earth every day.
Most are blocked by Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field, but some reach the ground. 
Cosmic rays can tell us about the universe, including its chemical and physical makeup, and how it has changed over time.
